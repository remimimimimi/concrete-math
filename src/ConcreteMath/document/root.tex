\begin{abstract}
  This entry implements formally verified proof verifier for Metamath called
  Concretemath, as well as establishes ground for reasoning about formal systems
  described in Metamath.

\section{Introduction}

This paper will describe thoroughly verified proof verifier of Metamath according to it's specification given in Metamath book \cite{metamath}


We have no need to formalize all text that may appear in metamath database as we
should work mostly AST of the metamath formal languages. All non-essential text
parts of the database will be handled by the parser that will be written as ML
module.

As well as we have no need in formalizing all text of a database, we have no
need in formalizing preprocessor directives, that includes database part from
other file, removes comments, and removes theorems with incomplete proofs.

% include generated text of all theories
